					<h2>Openings<br><small>Postdoctoral Research Associate position in Embeded Systems</small></h2>
				Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL), University of Notre Dame<br><br>
				The mission of SCL is to address reliability and security challenges emerged in problems at device, circuit and system scales. Supported by federal agencies including National Science Foundation and Air Force Research Lab, and industry companies including IBM, Intel, ITRI and Ameren, our research interests include low-power design, three-dimensional integration, hardware security and renewable energy applications.
				<br><br>
				The project investigates systematic design of an implantable medical device. It is an interdisciplinary project that combines concepts from several research areas, including but not limited to embedded systems, ASIC design, mechatronics, system security, system validation & verification. As such, prospective applicant should have interest in such interdisciplinary research agenda. The selected candidate will have the opportunity to be part of designing real, physical medical device that will be deployed in China.
