					<h3>Sustainable Computing Laboratory (SCL)</h3>
					<p style="font-size:16px;">The mission of Sustainable Computing Laboratory is to address reliability
						and security challenges emerged in problems at device, circuit and system scales. Supported by
						federal agencies including National Science Foundation and Air Force Research Lab, and industry
						companies including IBM, Intel, ITRI and Ameren, we focus on four research themes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="project.html#link1">Machine Learning for Medical Applications. </a></li>
						<li><a href="project.html#link2">Hardware/Software Co-Exploration for Neural Architectures. </a>
						</li>
						<li><a href="project.html#link3">Uncertainties in Neural Networks. </a></li>
						<li><a href="project.html#link4">Statistical Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) for
								Acceleration. </a></li>
