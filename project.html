				<h1 id='link1'> 1. Machine Learning for Medical Applications.</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>The volume and complexity of diagnostic imaging are increasing at a pace faster than the availability of human expertise to interpret it.  Recently machine learning especially AI has shown great potential in medical data analysis, medical image processing, and automatic diagnosis and surgery assistance with improved quality of healthcare and largely reduced cost. </p>
					<p>There are three main challenges in machine learning for medical applications. 1) plenty of sources in multiple formats, e.g., MRI, CT, ultrasound, file; 2) great anatomy and structure variance; 3) training difficulty: a few training data due to expensive labeling and a large size of each training data (e.g., the size of a CT image is about 512*512*(200-400));</p>
					<p>We propose to combine AI and traditional computer vision methods to solve the above problems and implement clinic-acceptable automatic segmentation and diagnosis methods/frameworks/systems. Recently, we focus on a very challenging medical application, cognitive heart disease (CHD). We have published several papers in top AI conferences and the first segmentation dataset of CHD to the public.</p>

							<h1 id='link1'> 1. Hardware/Software Co-Exploration for Neural Architectures. <a
									href="slides/codesign-nas.pdf" title="codesign-nas">[slides]</a></h1>
							<hr />
							<p> As the increasing number of applications (ranging from mobile and connected home to
								security, surveillance and automotive) that combine edge computing and machine learning,
								implementing neural networks on edge devices become ever more important; however, with
								limited hardware resources on the edge devices and the restricted timing specification,
								neural networks that attain state-of-the-art accuracy will not fit. We establish that in
								order to achieve the highest accuracy and hardware efficiency on the edge, it is best to
								co-explore hardware design and neural architecture (the above figure), rather than
								taking state-of-the-art approaches that either explore neural architecture only assuming
								fixed hardware, or explore hardware design only assuming fixed neural architecture. The
								proposed co-exploration framework opens up the hardware design freedom, which can
								significantly push forward the Pareto frontiers between hardware efficiency and test
								accuracy, and we can obtain much better design trade-offs than the existing approaches.
								Our contribution can be seen as an analogy to the concept of hardware-software
								co-design, which has prevailed due to its superior. </p>

							<p>We aim to develop a full-stack tool to support co-exploration of neural architecture and
								hardware design from (1) optimization of fixed neural network on FPGAs; (2)
								FPGA-implementation aware NAS; (3) co-explore neural architectures on multiple FPGAs;
								(4) co-explore neural architecture on network-on-chip-based scalable hardware. </p>

						<h1 id='link2'> 2. On-Device Personalized AI.</h1>
						<hr />
						<p> Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques have been deployed in an
							increasing number of local devices at the user end for better privacy-preserving and quick
							response. The applications range from autonomous driving, personal health assitance, to
							comprehensive vital signs monitoring. In the real-world application scenarios, all these
							integrated advanced techniques are targeting an overarching goal: enhancing personalized
							experiences. This involves providing precise detection for each individual subject, as well
							as personalized plans and preventative actions based on the ambient environments. However,
							the inter- and intra-subject variability, changing system requirements as well as unstable
							conditions make it difficult to ensure optimal service across users. The AI/ML models need
							to be properly personalized for better user experiences. On the other hand, the limited
							hardware resources (in terms of memory capacity, computing power, energy budget, etc) of
							local devices greatly hinder the development of advanced AI/ML approaches on the local end.
						</p>
						<p> We aim to develop a algorithm-system co-design framework to address the aforementioned
							challenges to support the development of personalized AI/ML on resource-constrained
							local-end hardware platforms. The framework ranges from 1) Optimizations on tiny deep model
							generalization; 2) Prior-incorported regulated deep model personalization; 3) AIGC-based
							self-supervised personalization; and 4) TinyML design paradigm. </p>

						<h1 id='link3'> 3. Unsupervised Medical Image Computing. </h1>
						<hr />
						<p> The success of deep learning heavily depends on the availability of large labeled training
							sets. However, it is hard to get large labeled datasets in the medical image domain because
							of the strict privacy concern and costly labeling efforts. Therefore, it is desirable that
							the DNNs can leverage the numerous unlabeled medical data to achieve higher performance with
							limited annotations. Contrastive learning, as a self-supervised learning (SSL) method, has
							shown great success in learning image-level features from large-scale unlabeled data. The
							main idea of contrastive learning is to contrast the similarities of sample pairs in the
							representation space through contrastive loss, pulling the representations of similar pairs
							(a.k.a. positive pairs) together and pushing the representations of dissimilar pairs (a.k.a.
							negative pairs) apart. After pre-training, the trained encoder can be used as the
							initialization to improve downstream tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.
							We aim to leverage the underlying structural information in medical image for SSL and
							propose several techniques (e.g., contrastive image synthesis, positional contrastive
							learning, BYOL-TracIN, etc.) to enhance its representation learning ability in the medical
							image field. </p>

				<p class="text-left">This research involves developing ADAS application on resource constrained hardware platform. With the help of computer vision, machine/deep learning and hardware acceleration, the goal is to get the system running in real-time while keeping the extremely high accuracy and robustness. The functions of ADAS include but not limited to lane departure warning (LDW), forward collision warning (FCW), traffic sign recognization (TSR) and pedestrian collision warning (PCW). </p>

<h2>Security analysis of power grids</h2>
				<p class="text-left">The real time anomaly detection in wide area monitoring of smart grids is critical to enhance the reliability of power systems. However, capturing the features of anomalous interruption and then detecting them at real time is difficult for large-scale smart grids, because the measurement data volume and complexity increases drastically with the exponential growth of data from the immense intelligent monitoring devices to be rolled out and the need for fast information retrieval from those mass data. Most of existing anomaly detection methods fail to handle it well. </p>
<p class="text-left">We propose a spatial-temporal correlation based anomalous behavior model to capture the characteristics of anomaly such as transmission line outages in smart grid. The proposed real time anomaly detection algorithm overcomes the issue of gigantic measurement data volume. The proposed algorithm is not only suitable for large number of power systems with high dimensional measurement data, but at the same time is also low computational complexity to apply for real time detection. </p>
